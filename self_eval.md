# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
    - Sometimes I get a little dyslexic with greater than or less than, and I still have to refer to syntax notes.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
    - These make a lot of sense to me.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
    - Remembering to use elsif and end sometimes escapes me.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
    - Nearly an hour. I need to get faster.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
    - I don't need to adjust my calendar, and I'm making cheat sheets to put on my desk until I'm comfortable using these opperations more frequently.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
    - If I have questions I'll google first, then ask in the small group slack, then the large group if still needed.
